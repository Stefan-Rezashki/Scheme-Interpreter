# Scheme-Interpreter
This project implements a interpreter written in Racket. It includes a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) that allows users to interactively evaluate expressions. The interpreter supports basic arithmetic, list manipulation, conditionals, variable definitions, and custom function creation, as well as special forms like define, if, cond, and lambda.
